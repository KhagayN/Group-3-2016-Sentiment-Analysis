# Group-3 ( 2016 Presidential Sentiment Analysis)

This GitHub repository stores the code that was written to perform a sentiment anaylsis of tweets about the 2016 presidential candidates. This project was created during the Information Visualization course taught at NYU-Poly by Professor Bertini. 

The project works as such:
tweets were saved for a month long period and then a dictionary machine language approach was utilized to assign a sentiment to each tweet. These scores were then aggregated by state and candidate and subsequently visualized.
